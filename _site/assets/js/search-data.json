While other filaments were not tested, it is likely that PLA, PETG, and ASA (and others) would all work provided that the nozzle size and layer height are preserved. Details about the finger exoskeleton are in the relevant section. ",

    "content": "We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile, electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging. This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam), with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory modality for soft robots. SCANS Overview . ArXiv . IEEE Xplore Coming Soon .

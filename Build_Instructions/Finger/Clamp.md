# SCANS Clamp

[Insert picture here]

The clamp is the base of the SCANS finger, and is responsible for clamping down on the pneumatic bladder to maintain pressure, while also keeping the QTH bulbs aligned with the PMMA fibers embedded in the finger exoskeleton.

Printed parts needed:
- 

COTS parts needed:
- M3 heat-set insert (x2)
- M3 bolt (x2)
- SMA threaded connector (x2)
- Pneumatic coupling (x1)

Supplies needed:
- Soldering iron (optional heat-set insert installation tips)
- [large size] drill bit
- [small size] drill bit

## Instructions

### Step 1:

After removing support material from the printed parts, insert the two heat-set threaded inserts into the clamp base.

### Step 2: 

Ream out the waveguide holes and the spectral fiber holes.

### Step 3: 

Screw in the SMA connectors into the threaded holes, making sure that they are fully bottomed-out. A pair of rubber-jaw pliers or rubber gloves can ensure a better grip on the threads without damaging them. Also screw in the pneumatic coupling into the nylon backstop.

# Finger Assembly

Components needed:
- Bladder and Clamp sub-assembly
- TPU exoskeleton with embedded components
- PCB with all components soldered

## Instructions

### Step 1: 

Inspect the holes at the bottom of the bladder clamp and ensure that they are free of any debris. It is common for some Sil-Poxy to leak into them and cure when attaching the bladder. Next, remove the three long bolts and slot the PCB into place on the back of the clamp.

### Step 2:

Put the tip of the bladder into the back of the TPU exoskeleton. Slowly work the bladder down the length of the exoskeleton until the exposed PMMA fibers are close to the clamp. Line up the four fibers with the holes in the clamp bottom, and pull on the bladder tip to ease the two halves together. Once the clamp is flush with the TPU exoskeleton, screw the three long bolts back on so that the nuts are on the PCB side.

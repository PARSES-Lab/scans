# SCANS Finger

The SCANS Finger is the component with the most sub-components, and thus a page is dedicated to the fabrication of each one. The major components needed to assemble the SCANS Finger are: 
- Cast silicone air bladder connected to the 3D printed clamp
- PCB with components soldered
- Spectral Fibers with cast silicone cladding and prisms glued
- Finger exoskeleton with embedded fibers

While most steps can be repeated, it is recommended that a single SCANS finger is completed before the two others, to ensure that all the steps are performed correctly and the finger functions as expected

# Build Instructions

The SCANS gripper is comprised of three SCANS fingers, the laser-cut baseplate, and the wiring and pneumatic harness to handle the electrical and air lines to the fingers. This guide will walk you through the fabrication and assembly of each component. 

## Bill of Materials

## Initial Fabrication

To begin assembly, 3D-print all of the components in [STEP file reference], and have the PCB's fabricated. Save for the finger exoskeleton, all of the 3D-printed parts were printed on a Markforged X7 using their default settings for Onyx (Carbon-Fiber Nylon) and a 0.4mm nozzle at a 0.1mm layer height. While other filaments were not tested, it is likely that PLA, PETG, and ASA (and others) would all work provided that the nozzle size and layer height are preserved. Details about the finger exoskeleton are in the relevant section.
